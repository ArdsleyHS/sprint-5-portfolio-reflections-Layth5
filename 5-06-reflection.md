1. Consider your solution for the second project that added a search button.
a. Provide a screenshot of the search button procedure.

b. Provide a screenshot of the code that calls the search procedure.

c. Describe what the search procedure does.

Searching is like using special instructions (algorithms) to find and get the information you need from the internet or databases.

d. Describe how the search procedure contributes to the overall functionality of the program.

The search procedure is important for the program because it helps find the right information quickly and makes the program work well.

e. Explain in detailed steps how the search procedure works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it.

When you search for something, the program looks at your words, finds the best information, and shows it to you in a list that you can click on.

2. Consider testing your search procedure.

a. Describe two possible calls to the search procedure that pass a different argument and cause a different segment of the search procedure to execute.

If you search for "Science," it finds general information about science, but if you search for "Space exploration," it looks for details specifically about space exploration.

b. Describe the condition(s) being tested by each call you described.

The first search checks if it finds general info about "Science," and the second one sees if it gets details about the full phrase "Space exploration."

I can't tell you what the searches would show because we didn't actually do them.
