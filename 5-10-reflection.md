# 5.10 Impacts of CS

1. How do web search tools make it more efficient to find information?

When you use web search tools, they create a list of your past searches, making it easier and faster for you to find the right information later on.

2. When you type a word or phrase into the Google search engine, what is the search algorithm that is being used? Explain in your own words the process used by Google's search engine.

When you type something into Google, it uses a special formula to find what you're looking for in a list, so the results match what you want.

3. What is a captcha? How has the collective efforts of Internet users contributed to analyzing images through captchas?

Captcha is a program designed to tell if you're a person or a machine, often used to stop spam and automated data collection from websites. When you solve a captcha with an image, it needs a "human touch" to figure it out.

4. "The architecture of human knowledge has changed as a result of search." Do you agree? Explain your reasoning.

I agree that how we access knowledge has changed due to search. Before computers were common, people used other methods to find information. Nowadays, we can easily search online using various browsers, programs, and search algorithms.

5. What are the differences between Figures 4.10 and Figure 4.11 in the book? Why are there differences even though they are both a Google search results page?

In Figure 4.10, Google shows fair information about Falun Gong, but in Figure 4.11, it's mostly negative. This happens because they are searched on different Google enginesâ€”one in the U.S and one in China, affecting what comes up.

6. How do you think mobile computing might have influenced web searches?

Chapter 4 discussed mobile computing, including "per click" functions. Another topic covered was the issue of advertisements paying to display their information, even when someone innocently searches for something unrelated to the shown ad.

7. Would you retain your search history or delete it? Why?

I would delete as it is my personal information.

8. Should a researcher place absolute trust in a search engine? Why or why not?

Researchers shouldn't fully rely on search engines because it's unsafe and could lead to errors in their future work.

9. The authors claim "search is a new form of control over information" (p. 111) and "search is power" (p. 145). Why might it be important to talk about the social implications of searching on the Internet?

Talking about the impact of internet searches is important because if people don't know about the risks, they might end up on websites with wrong or old information, or even get viruses and hacked.

10. How have search trends been used to predict information? What are the positive and negative impacts of using trends to make predictions?

Looking at what people search for can show if information is wrong. But when trends are used to show specific info, it can be changed easily, causing problems.

11. Find and read an article about web searches or algorithms. Write a 3-4 paragraph summary of the article. Include the author's name, the title of the article, the date it was published, and a link to the article.

The article "What Google Search Isn't Showing You" by Anna Wiener talks about how Google search results might not always show the most helpful or diverse information. It was published on February 6, 2023. The author explains that search engines like Google use algorithms to decide what to display, and sometimes this can limit the variety of sources and perspectives we see. The article suggests that relying solely on search results may not give us a complete picture, and it encourages readers to be aware of the limitations of search engines.
