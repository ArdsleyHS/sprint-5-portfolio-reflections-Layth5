# 5.3 Search Algorithms

1. (POGIL) Define a pseudocode algorithm that will efficiently play the guessing game.

Select a random number between 1 and 100.
Get a guess from the user
If the guess is too low say "Too Low"
If the guess is too high say "Too High"
If the user is correct say "Your guess is correct."

2. (POGIL) To guess a number between 1 and 100, what's the maximum number of guesses your algorithm would take?

   100

4. (POGIL) To guess a number between 1 and 500, what's the maximum number of guesses your algorithm would take?

500
5. Suppose you have a deck of cards and you want to find the Ace of Spades. If the deck is shuffled, which is the best search algorithm to use and why?

1/52

6. Give an example of a search problem you encounter in everyday life. Does it use sequential, binary, or some other search algorithm?

Whenever the bus comes it has a chance to come earlier, later or just on time. This is a search algorithim.
