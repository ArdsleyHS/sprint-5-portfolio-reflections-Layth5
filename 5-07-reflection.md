# 5.07 Analyzing Algorithms

1. Present the results and the analysis you did for each of the experiments in this lesson, -- i.e., the table of running times you observed, the graphs you created, and the conclusions you reached regarding the searching algorithms and sorting algorithms. Provide a clear description, referring to your graphs and your tabulated data, to explain how you arrived at your conclusions.

a. Insert the table of running times you observed (you'll have to look up how to make a table using Markdown syntax).

b. Insert a screenshot of the graph you created (again, using proper Markdown syntax).

c. Write the conclusions you reached regarding the search algorithms. Provide a clear description, referring to your graphs and your data and graphs, to explain how you arrived at your conclusions.

As the range increases so does the value
