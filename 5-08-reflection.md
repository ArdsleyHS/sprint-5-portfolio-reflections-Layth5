# 5.08 Limits of Algorithms

1. (POGIL) A ***password scheme*** consists of a minimum password length and the different types of symbols (i.e., letters, numbers, specials) that can be used in the password. Using the Password Strength Calculator, determine the optimal scheme for withstanding a brute force attack of at least 10 years by an ordinary PC performing 100 million tests per second.

The optimal scheme for withstanding a brute force attack would be 9, and this would take 10 years by an ordinary PC.

2. (POGIL) According to [this 2020 article](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/316266-the-nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-can-probably-crack-your-passwords), a password-cracking computer can try 669 billion passwords per second. How would you have to modify your scheme to withstand a 10-year attack by this specially designed computer?

I would modify my password length to 11 characters. This would be able to stand a 10 year attack.

3. (POGIL) After youâ€™ve calculated the estimated number of passwords that can be checked per second for the next year, use the Password Strength Calculator to determine an optimal password scheme.

a. How long should the password be?

10 characters

b. What combination of characters should it include?

letters upercase,lowercase letters and special characters.

4. This lesson introduces the concept of an intractable problem.

a. Explain in your own words what it means for a problem to be intractable.

Intractable problems are problems for which there exist no efficient algorithms to solve them.

b. Why is that a good thing when it comes to passwords?

It protects your personal data.

5. (POGIL) For the routes starting and ending at Trinity College, identify the nearest neighbor route and the optimal route. What does this show you about the nearest neighbor heuristic?

The nearest neighbor route is ACB, and interestingly, the nearest optimal route is also ACB. This illustrates that the nearest neighbor heuristic is effective only on certain occasions, not consistently.

6. Describe a heuristic you use in your everyday life. Why is a heuristic needed for this situation?

I usually take the quickest way I know when going places because it saves time.
