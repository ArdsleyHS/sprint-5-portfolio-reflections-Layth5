# 5.04 Sorting Algorithms

1. Bubble and Merge Sort are referred to as comparison sorts because the values of the two pieces of data are compared during each step. Why are the radix and bucket sort not comparison sorts?

Bucket sort and radix sort are not considered comparison sorts because they do not involve directly comparing the data; instead, they rely on calculations for their sorting mechanisms.

2. Which sort do you think would be the fastest if you had to sort more than one deck of cards? Why?

Using bucket sort would be more efficient, as it allows you to organize the shuffled stack by grouping each number together and subsequently dividing them based on their suits.
