# 5.09 Parallel Computing

1. (POGIL) Explain how a parallel algorithm speeds up a solution to a problem compared to a sequential algorithm using the POGIL activities with searching and sorting cards as examples.

Parallel algorithms make problem-solving faster by having multiple processors work simultaneously. In POGIL with cards, it's like many hands helping at once instead of one after another.

2. (POGIL) What was the speed up you measured in these activities?

speedup = 160 seconds sequential time

3. (POGIL) Did the speed up you measured change proportionally to the number of processors? For example, if you doubled the number of processors, did the speed double, less than double, or more than double? Explain what you believe led to the results you observed.

 If you did process X on processor 1 at the same time as doing process Y and then Z on processor 2, processor 1 would be done in 60 seconds and processor 2 would be done in 80 sections (50+30).

4. (POGIL) What are the benefits and challenges of parallel computing?

Parallel computing speeds up tasks by having many processors work at the same time, but it can be challenging to program and might not be suitable for all types of problems.
