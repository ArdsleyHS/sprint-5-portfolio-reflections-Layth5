# 5.09 Parallel Computing

1. (POGIL) Explain how a parallel algorithm speeds up a solution to a problem compared to a sequential algorithm using the POGIL activities with searching and sorting cards as examples.

2. (POGIL) What was the speed up you measured in these activities?

3. (POGIL) Did the speed up you measured change proportionally to the number of processors? For example, if you doubled the number of processors, did the speed double, less than double, or more than double? Explain what you believe led to the results you observed.

4. (POGIL) What are the benefits and challenges of parallel computing?
